	abstract = {Permafrost peatlands store large amounts of carbon potentially vulnerable to decomposition. However, the fate of that carbon in a changing climate remains uncertain in models due to complex interactions among hydrological, biogeochemical, microbial, and plant processes. In this study, we estimated effects of climate forcing biases present in global climate reanalysis products on carbon cycle predictions at a thawing permafrost peatland in subarctic Sweden. The analysis was conducted with a comprehensive biogeochemical model (ecosys) across a permafrost thaw gradient
encompassing intact permafrost palsa with an ice core and a shallow active layer, partly thawed bog with a deeper active layer and a variable water table, and fen with a water table close to the surface, each with distinct vegetation and microbiota. Using in situ observations to correct
local cold and wet biases found in the Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3 ({GSWP}3) climate reanalysis forcing, we demonstrate good model performance by comparing predicted and observed carbon dioxide ({CO}2) and methane ({CH}4) exchanges, thaw depth, and water table depth. The simulations driven by the bias-corrected climate suggest that the three peatland types currently accumulate carbon from the atmosphere, although the bog and fen sites can have annual positive radiative forcing impacts due to their higher {CH}4 emissions. Our simulations indicate that projected precipitation increases could accelerate {CH}4 emissions from the palsa area, even without further degradation of palsa permafrost. The {GSWP}3 cold and wet biases for this site significantly alter simulation results and lead to erroneous active layer depth ({ALD}) and carbon budget estimates. Biases in simulated {CO}2 and {CH}4 exchanges from biased climate forcing
are as large as those among the thaw stages themselves at a landscape scale across the examined permafrost thaw gradient. Future studies should thus not only focus on changes in carbon budget associated with morphological changes in thawing permafrost, but also recognize the effects of climate forcing uncertainty on carbon cycling.},

In Stordalen peatland complex (68.20°N, 19.03°E) recent permafrost thaw has caused a conversion of the palsa parts (an ombrotrophic, permafrost affected peatland type) into both bog and flow-through fen peatland types. Within the Stordalen peatland complex we estimated the {DOC} mass balance and assessed {DOC} composition for one palsa catchment, one bog catchment and two fens in order to assess the possible impacts of permafrost thaw on peatland complex {DOC} export. The fens were found to have higher net {DOC} export rates at 8.1 and 7.0 g C m−2 yr−1 than either the palsa or bog catchments, at 3.2 and 3.5 g C m−2 yr−1, respectively. The snowmelt period was more important for the annual {DOC} export from the palsa and bog catchments than for the fens, representing 65–100\% of the palsa and bog catchment exports while 35–60\% of the net fen exports. {DOC} exported from the palsa and bog catchments were characterized by high aromaticity, molecular weight, C/N ratios, and contained {DOC} of primarily terrestrial origin. The fens exhibited a shift in {DOC} composition between inflows and outflows that suggested that fens act as catchment locations for degradation and transformation of {DOC}. Permafrost thaw can thus alter the magnitude, timing, and composition of subarctic peatland {DOC} exports due to interactions among peatland type, permafrost conditions, and hydrological setting.},

	abstract = {Permafrost peatlands contain globally important amounts of soil organic carbon, owing to cold conditions which suppress anaerobic decomposition. However, climate warming and permafrost thaw threaten the stability of this carbon store. The ultimate fate of permafrost peatlands and their carbon stores is unclear because of complex feedbacks between peat accumulation, hydrology and vegetation. Field monitoring campaigns only span the last few decades and therefore provide an incomplete picture of permafrost peatland response to recent rapid warming. Here we use a high-resolution palaeoecological approach to understand the longer-term response of peatlands in contrasting states of permafrost degradation to recent rapid warming. At all sites we identify a drying trend until the late-twentieth century; however, two sites subsequently experienced a rapid shift to wetter conditions as permafrost thawed in response to climatic warming, culminating in collapse of the peat domes. Commonalities between study sites lead us to propose a five-phase model for permafrost peatland response to climatic warming. This model suggests a shared ecohydrological trajectory towards a common end point: inundated Arctic fen. Although carbon accumulation is rapid in such sites, saturated soil conditions are likely to cause elevated methane emissions that have implications for climate-feedback mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Arctic peatlands are mire ecosystems distributed across the vast northern edges of the Eurasian and North American continents and the islands and coastal areas of the Arctic and far northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Arctic peatlands are mostly represented by “frozen” mires with much of their organic deposits remaining frozen throughout the year, whose water regime and other characteristics are strongly dependent on permafrost.Primary production in arctic peatlands is low, but the tendency for peat to accumulate is enhanced by the low decomposition rates. The peat layer in arctic peatlands is not thick, and only in rare cases does the peat exceed 4–6 m in depth. Three main permafrost processes are responsible for the variability of arctic frozen peatlands: thermokarst, frost heaving, and cracking. Arctic peatland diversity and distribution across the landscape depends on the climate conditions, permafrost presence, and hydrology-connected landscape dynamics, and adheres to a characteristic pattern which is beneficial to consider in inventory, mapping, or planning of wetland management.The ecosystem diversity of arctic peatlands is presented by paludified shallow peatlands; “frozen” peatland types such as polygon mires, peat plateaus, and palsa mires; and “nonfrozen” peatland types like patterned string fens, raised bogs, riparian mires, coastal tundra, and some types of coastal marsh.Arctic ecosystems are characterized by low species diversity, and typical species are highly specialized and intimately linked to their habitats. The short growing season limits annual production and the ecological niche capacity of these species.Arctic peatlands are highly integrated ecosystems which are extremely fragile to both natural and human-induced perturbations.With climate change, the arctic region will continue to warm more rapidly than the global mean. Peat, as a thermo-isolating material, plays a crucial role in minimizing permafrost thaw. However, climate change-induced peatland degradation introduces positive feedback with permafrost thaw. Accompanying rapid in situ peat decomposition is an increase in greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions, specifically methane from saturated peat water and that which was formerly bound in frozen permafrost.Development in such areas often ignores the special hydrological and ecological characteristics that are central to the productivity of these areas. Increased development of the oil and gas industry and its supporting transport infrastructure significantly fragments the landscape and disrupts its hydrology. Even traditional land uses such as reindeer herding are being industrialized. The resulting changes in peatland status will in turn restrict use of the land by the indigenous people who have traditionally depended on peatlands for food including herded reindeer, game, and fish.Thus, there is an urgent need to promote sustainable practices.},

Regional distribution of the presence/absence of localized permafrost peatlands relative to expansive peat plateaus (peatland completely underlain by permafrost) shows that a north to south landform gradient exists that is dominantly controlled by mean annual temperature. Percent cover of localized permafrost peatland in an area is best explained by the amount of total peatland cover that can support it. Localized permafrost is associated with collapse forms (internal lawns) throughout the range of its occurrence in western Canada.

	abstract = {Permafrost dynamics play an important role in high-latitude peatland carbon balance and are key to understanding the future response of soil carbon stocks. Permafrost aggradation can control the magnitude of the carbon feedback in peatlands through effects on peat properties. We compiled peatland plant macrofossil records for the northern permafrost zone (515 cores from 280 sites) and classified samples by vegetation type and environmental class (fen, bog, tundra and boreal permafrost, and thawed permafrost). We examined differences in peat properties (bulk density, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and organic matter content, and C/N ratio) and C accumulation rates among vegetation types and environmental classes. Consequences of permafrost aggradation differed between boreal and tundra biomes, including differences in vegetation composition, C/N ratios, and N content. The vegetation composition of tundra permafrost peatlands was similar to permafrost-free fens, while boreal permafrost peatlands more closely resembled permafrost-free bogs. Nitrogen content in boreal permafrost and thawed permafrost peatlands was significantly lower than in permafrost-free bogs despite similar vegetation types (0.9\% versus 1.5\% N). Median long-term C accumulation rates were higher in fens (23 g C m−2 yr−1) than in permafrost-free bogs (18 g C m−2 yr−1) and were lowest in boreal permafrost peatlands (14 g C m−2 yr−1). The plant macrofossil record demonstrated transitions from fens to bogs to permafrost peatlands, bogs to fens, permafrost aggradation within fens, and permafrost thaw and reaggradation. Using data synthesis, we have identified predominant peatland successional pathways, changes in vegetation type, peat properties, and C accumulation rates associated with permafrost aggradation.},

	abstract = {Throughout the Holocene, northern peatlands have both accumulated carbon and emitted methane. Their impact on climate radiative forcing has been the net of cooling (persistent {CO}2 uptake) and warming (persistent {CH}4 emission). We evaluated this by developing very simple Holocene peatland carbon flux trajectories, and using these as inputs to a simple atmospheric perturbation model. Flux trajectories are based on estimates of contemporary {CH}4 flux (15–50 Tg {CH}4 yr−1), total accumulated peat C (250–450 Pg C), and peatland initiation dates. The contemporary perturbations to the atmosphere due to northern peatlands are an increase of ∼100 ppbv {CH}4 and a decrease of ∼35 ppmv {CO}2. The net radiative forcing impact northern peatlands is currently about −0.2 to −0.5 W m−2 (a cooling). It is likely that peatlands initially caused a net warming of up to +0.1 W m−2, but have been causing an increasing net cooling for the past 8000–11 000 years. A series of sensitivity simulations indicate that the current radiative forcing impact is determined primarily by the magnitude of the contemporary methane flux and the magnitude of the total C accumulated as peat, and that radiative forcing dynamics during the Holocene depended on flux trajectory, but the overall pattern was similar in all cases.},

	abstract = {The enzymatic latch hypothesis proposes that oxygen (O2) limitation promotes wetland carbon (C) storage by indirectly decreasing the activities of hydrolytic enzymes that decompose organic matter. Humid tropical forest soils are often characterized by low and fluctuating redox conditions and harbor a large pool of organic matter, yet they also have the fastest decomposition rates globally. We tested the enzymatic latch hypothesis across a soil O2 gradient in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico, {USA}. Enzyme activities expressed on a soil mass basis did not systematically decline across a landscape O2 gradient, nor did phenolics accumulate, the proposed mechanism of the enzymatic latch. Normalizing enzyme activities by C concentrations did suggest a decline in several enzymes as mean soil O2 decreased. However, relationships between hydrolytic enzymes and reducing conditions were scale-dependent: enzymes displayed neutral to strongly positive relationships with reducing conditions and phenolics when comparing samples within sites, and enzyme activities in 18-d anaerobic incubations generally exceeded those in aerobic soils despite a fourfold increase in phenolics. In summary, although O2 availability and the activities of some enzymes appeared to be related at landscape scales after accounting for differences in organic matter, reducing conditions and phenolic compounds did not appear to constrain soil hydrolytic enzyme activity at the scale of soil microsites, challenging the enzymatic latch hypothesis. Hydrolytic enzymes can be resilient to periodic anaerobiosis and may actually stimulate O2 consumption at the microsite scale. We suggest a critical re-examination of mechanisms and the scale dependence of couplings between O2 and decomposition in terrestrial soils.},

	abstract = {Unique peatland properties, such as their ability to preserve intact ancient human remains (bog bodies) and to store globally significant quantities of atmospheric {CO}2, can be attributed to their low rates of enzymic decomposition. Peatland soils are normally devoid of molecular oxygen in all, but the uppermost layer, and thus enzymes such as phenol oxidase, which require molecular oxygen for their activity, are rarely active. Interestingly, even the activities of enzymes such as hydrolases that have no oxygen requirement, are also extremely limited in peatlands. Here, we show that those low hydrolase activities can be indirectly attributed to oxygen constraints on phenol oxidase. On addition of oxygen, phenol oxidase activity increased 7-fold, P{\textless}0.05, a response that allowed phenolic depletion in the peatland soil. Phenolic materials are highly inhibitory to enzymes and their lower abundance allowed higher hydrolase activities (β-glucosidase 26\%, P{\textless}0.05, phosphatase 18\%, P{\textless}0.05, sulphatase 47\%, P{\textless}0.01, xylosidase 16\%, P{\textless}0.05 and chitinase 22\%, P{\textless}0.05). Thus, oxygen constraints upon phenol oxidase activity promote conditions that inhibit decomposition. This mechanism has important implications for preservation of archaeological organic materials, sequestration of atmospheric {CO}2 and potentially in the preservation of food and treatment of water pollution.},

This permits accumulation of phenolic compounds that are potent inhibitors of hydrolase enzymes–major agents in the breakdown of organic matter. In our study we investigate the importance of the molecular weight of phenolics on levels of inhibition of microbial decomposition in peat. We found the higher the molecular weight, of a phenolic compound, the greater its inhibitory effect on the breakdown of organic matter.},

	abstract = {Peatlands are long-term sinks of atmospheric carbon (C) largely due to water-saturated soil conditions, decay-resistant plant litter, and the presence of biochemical compounds such as soluble phenolics. As phenolics are known inhibitors of microbial enzymes in soils, the concept of the ‘enzymic latch’ on peat C was introduced, assuming that phenolics accumulate in peat water due to protection from degradation by oxidative enzymes as a result of anoxia. However, their inhibitory role in peat has not been unambiguously confirmed. We aimed to verify whether peat phenolics inhibit microbial and enzyme activities in laboratory-incubated Sphagnum litter, and bog and fen peat. Soluble humic substances were extracted from bog water as a source of natural phenolics and separated into two molecular-weight fractions. We tested the effects of (1) phenolics concentration, (2) their molecular weight and (3) anoxia on the activity of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes, and on microbial respiration rate. The added phenolics did not suppress hydrolytic enzyme activities nor microbial respiration. Quite the contrary, phenolics addition (up to 1000 mg L−1) sometimes supported enzyme and microbial activities, indicating that phenolics (or another constituent of peat humic substances) served as a source of C. The activities of hydrolytic enzymes did not vary between oxic and anoxic peat but were double in oxic than anoxic conditions in Sphagnum litter. Differences in enzymatic and microbial activities were driven by peat type with about three times greater microbial respiration rates and enzyme activities in fen peats. Our results do not support the concept of the enzymic latch, particularly its key assumption that peat phenolics inhibit hydrolytic enzymes. While the concept was established on oceanic peatlands with low phenolic concentrations, the peat microbial community in our experiments seemed acclimated to the naturally high phenolic concentrations, characteristic for other, non-oceanic northern peatlands. Thus, the enzymic latch should not be considered as a determinative mechanism preserving the global C store in peatlands.},

	abstract = {Permafrost soils contain enormous amounts of organic carbon, which could act as a positive feedback to global climate change due to enhanced respiration rates with warming. We have used a terrestrial ecosystem model that includes permafrost carbon dynamics, inhibition of respiration in frozen soil layers, vertical mixing of soil carbon from surface to permafrost layers, and {CH}4 emissions from flooded areas, and which better matches new circumpolar inventories of soil carbon stocks, to explore the potential for carbon-climate feedbacks at high latitudes. Contrary to model results for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report ({IPCC} {AR}4), when permafrost processes are included, terrestrial ecosystems north of 60°N could shift from being a sink to a source of {CO}2 by the end of the 21st century when forced by a Special Report on Emissions Scenarios ({SRES}) A2 climate change scenario. Between 1860 and 2100, the model response to combined {CO}2 fertilization and climate change changes from a sink of 68 Pg to a 27 + -7 Pg sink to 4 + -18 Pg source, depending on the processes and parameter values used. The integrated change in carbon due to climate change shifts from near zero, which is within the range of previous model estimates, to a climate-induced loss of carbon by ecosystems in the range of 25 + -3 to 85 + -16 Pg C, depending on processes included in the model, with a best estimate of a 62 + -7 Pg C loss. Methane emissions from high-latitude regions are calculated to increase from 34 Tg {CH}4/y to 41–70 Tg {CH}4/y, with increases due to {CO}2 fertilization, permafrost thaw, and warming-induced increased {CH}4 flux densities partially offset by a reduction in wetland extent.},

	abstract = {Mangrove swamps accumulate a significant amount (45–98 \%) of organic carbon in sediments; however, there is a knowledge gap in explaining the mechanism behind this. Through the analysis of substrate samples from a red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) swamp in southwest Florida, {USA}, this study investigated whether the “enzymic latch”, which suppresses decomposition in northern peatlands, is prevalent in mangrove soils. Laboratory analyses were performed to investigate the four hypotheses of the “enzymic latch”. Results showed that under aerobic conditions mangroves soil samples have significantly higher phenol oxidase activity (two-fold, p {\textless} 0.05), but lower phosphatase activity (−33 \%, p {\textless} 0.05), β-glucosidase activity (−14 \%) and glucosaminidase activity (−11 \%) compared to anaerobic conditions. Soil samples supplemented with phenol oxidase showed significantly lower phenolic concentration (−8.3 \%, p {\textless} 0.01), but increased β-glucosidase (+79 \%, p {\textless} 0.05), xylosidase (+99 \%, p {\textless} 0.01) and glucosaminidase (+102 \%, p {\textless} 0.01) activities. Supplementation of lignin-based solution significantly lowered β-glucosidase (−55 \%, p {\textless} 0.001), sulphatase (−82 \%, p {\textless} 0.001) and glucosaminidase (−45 \%, p {\textless} 0.01) activities. Based on these findings, it is concluded that the “enzymic latch” is highly likely to play a key role in suppressing decomposition rates in red mangrove covered areas of mangrove swamps.},
